                <h3>Weekend & Evening Courses</h3>
                <p>Education often appears to be an option only for those with free time
                     and unlimited resources. Here at Citi College of Canadian Careers, 
                     we disagree with this perception. Education is not limited to those who
                      can only be flexible to full-time hours. It is for everyone. 
                      We have built ourselves around this concept by offering 
                    evening and weekend classes that make learning flexible for you.</p>
